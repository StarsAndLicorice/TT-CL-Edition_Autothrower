# Stuff + why
- Auto sniping and lobbing binds + snipe delta logging (see: https://github.com/StarsAndLicorice/CJ)
    - All records were set with AHK, this is more efficient and more transparent
- No sprinting in TTR mode
    - All records using TTR camera mode were set without sprinting
- No magic word whisper pop-ups
    - Eats FPS = slower throws
    - It's logged via notify.info anyway
- Pre-determined lawyers in CJ
    - RNG bad
- Lawyers have 100% chance to attack player
    - RNG bad\
